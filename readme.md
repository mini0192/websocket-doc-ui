## Overview

`websocket-doc-ui` is a documentation tool for WebSocket APIs that runs exclusively on Spring Boot projects.  
It was created to address the lack of open-source solutions for documenting WebSocket endpoints.

This library helps you easily document and manage your WebSocket APIs, improving development productivity and collaboration.

---

## Features

- Automatic WebSocket API documentation for Spring Boot applications
- Intuitive UI for easy exploration of WebSocket endpoints
- Extensible architecture to support custom features

---

## Installation & Usage

### 1. Add dependency to your Gradle build

```gradle
dependencies {
    implementation("io.github.mini0192:websocket-doc-ui:0.0.1")
}
```
## Integration Guide
```java
@SpringBootApplication
@ComponentScan({"com.test", "com.websocket.core"}) // Add the library package here
public class TestApplication {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(TestApplication.class, args);
    }
}
```
- com.test is your applicationâ€™s base package.
- com.websocket.core is the package from the websocket-doc-ui library.

Including both packages in @ComponentScan ensures Spring detects components from your app and the library.
